# robs_galaxy_tools
Galaxy tool wrappers for bioinformatics tools.

Tools contained here are ones I have developed over the past 2 decades working in bioinformatics.  Some are fairly new and well written while some are very old (poorly written but) dependable & work well.  Most (if not all) are written in Perl.  I have a few not written in Perl, but we'll see if they make it in here.  I will be slowly adding legacy and new tools over time.
